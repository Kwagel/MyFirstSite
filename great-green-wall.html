    The Great Green Wall or Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel (French: Grande Muraille Verte pour le Sahara
    et le Sahel) is Africa's flagship initiative to combat the increasing desertification. Led by the African Union, the
    initiative aims to transform the lives of millions of people by creating a mosaic of green and productive landscapes
    across North Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the initial idea of a line of trees from east to west bordering the Saharan Desert, the vision of a Great Green
    Wall has evolved into that of a mosaic of interventions addressing the challenges facing the people in the Sahel and
    the Sahara. As a programming tool for rural development, the overall goal of this partnership is to strengthen
    regional resilience and natural systems with sound ecosystem management, protection of rural heritage, and improved
    living conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project is a response to the combined effect of natural resources degradation and drought in rural areas. It is
    a partnership that supports communities working towards sustainable management and use of forests, rangelands and
    other natural resources. It seeks to help communities mitigate and adapt to climate change, as well as improve food
    security.
  </p>
  <p>
    The population of the Sahel is expected to double by 2039, adding urgency to the project.

  <h2 id="History">History</h2>

  <p>
    In 1950s the British explorer Richard St. Barbe Baker made an expedition in the Sahara. During St. Barbe's
    40,000-kilometre (25,000 mi) expedition he proposed a "Green front" to act as a 50-kilometre-deep (30 mi) tree
    buffer to contain the expanding desert. The idea re-emerged in 2002, at the special summit in N'Djamena, the capital
    of Chad on the occasion of World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought. It was approved by the Conference of
    Leaders and Heads of States members of the Community of Sahel-Saharan States during their seventh ordinary session
    held in
    Ouagadougou in the capital of Burkina Faso on 1–2 June 2005. The African Union endorsed it in 2007 as the ‘Great
    Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative’ (GGWSSI).
  </p>
  <p>
    Lessons learnt from the Algerian Green Dam and the Green Wall of China led to an integrated multi-sectoral approach.
    Originally a tree planting initiative, the project evolved into a development programming tool. In 2007, CHSG
    directed the project to tackle the social, economic and environmental impacts of land degradation and
    desertification. The countries Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal,
    Sudan and Chad
    thereafter created the Panafrican Agency of the Great Green Wall (PAGGW).
  </p>
  <p>
    By 2016, about 15 per cent of the targeted acreage had been planted. In 2016, 21 countries had projects related to
    the GGW, including farmer-supported natural regeneration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bare land restoration has been successfully demonstrated in Burkina Faso, although security is an issue in the face
    of terrorist activity.

  <p>
    The Great Green Wall creates a barrier against climate change running across the Sahel region, through eleven
    countries
  </p>
  <p>
    Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other partners in the project include Algeria, Benin, Cape Verde, Egypt, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Gambia, and Tunisia.

  <p>
    The project encompasses the Saharan strip, north and south borders, including Saharan oases and enclaves, such as
    Cape Verde.
  </p>
  <p>
    The GGWSSI intends to strengthen existing mechanisms (such as Comprehensive African Agricultural Development
    Program, Environmental Program (CAADP) of NEPAD, regional, sub-regional, and national action programmes to combat
    desertification) to improve their efficiency through synergy and coordination activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Regional Harmonised Strategy emphasizes partnerships between stakeholders, integration into existing programmes,
    sharing of lessons learnt (especially through South-South cooperation and technology transfer), local participation
    and ownership of actions and developing more integrated and global planning.
  </p>
  <p>
    The $8-billion project intends to restore 100 million hectares (250 million acres; 1 million km<sup>2</sup>) of degraded land
    by 2030, which would create 350,000 rural jobs and absorb 250 million tonnes (250 million long tons; 280 million
    short tons) of CO2 from the atmosphere.

    The eco-friendly search engine <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Ecosia</a> has since 2014 started to partner up with the local
    population in Burkina Faso. In 2017 it has spread its campaign to Ethiopia and the following year to Senegal as
    well. According to Ecosia, it has planted over 16,940,947 trees and 12,384 ha (30,600 acres) were restored in
    Burkina Faso; in Senegal it planted over 1,424,748 and restored 300 ha (740 acres) and planted over 3,963,273 trees and
    restored 1,600 ha (4,000 acres) in Ethiopia as of 2 July 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though no other source for this can be found, in September 2017, the BBC reported that progress was best in Senegal.
    As of March 2019, 15 per cent of the wall is complete with significant gains made in Nigeria, Senegal and Ethiopia.
    In Senegal, over 11 million trees had been planted. Nigeria has restored 4.9 million ha (12 million acres; 49,000
    km<sup>2</sup>) of degraded land and Ethiopia has reclaimed 15 million ha (37 million acres; 150,000 km<sup>2</sup>). In September 2020 it was
    reported that the Great Green Wall had only covered 4% of the planned area, with only 4m hectares planted. Ethiopia
    has had the most success with 5.5bn seedlings planted, but Chad has only planted 1.1m. Doubt was raised over the
    survival rate of the 12m trees planted in Senegal.
